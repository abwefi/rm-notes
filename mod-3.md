### **Research Design**

**Definition**:
The arrangement of conditions for collecting and analyzing data in a way that combines relevance to the research purpose with procedural economy.

**Key Questions in Research Design**:
1. What is the study about?
2. Why is the study being made?
3. Where will the study be carried out?
4. What type of data is required?
5. Where can the required data be found?
6. What time period will the study include?
7. What will be the sample design?
8. What data collection techniques will be used?
9. How will the data be analyzed?
10. In what style will the report be prepared?

### **Sampling**

**Key Definitions**:
- **Population**: Collection of all units of interest.
- **Sample**: A representative subset of the population.
- **Sampling**: Technique of selecting a representative group from the population.

**Why Sampling?**
- Feasibility for data collection.
- Reduces resource demands.
- Produces quicker results with better accuracy.
- Ethically acceptable.

**Steps in Sample Design**:
1. **Type of Universe**: Define the set of objects (finite or infinite).
2. **Sampling Unit**: Could be geographical, constructional, social, or individual.
3. **Source List**: List of all items in the universe (for finite universes).
4. **Size of Sample**: Must be optimal to balance efficiency and accuracy.
5. **Parameters of Interest**: Define the specific population parameters.
6. **Budgetary Constraints**: Influence decisions on size and type of sample.
7. **Sampling Procedure**: Choose techniques with minimal error for given cost and size.

**Characteristics of a Good Sample Design**:
- Truly represents the population.
- Results can be extrapolated to the entire population.

**Types of Sampling**:
1. **Probability Sampling**:
   - Simple random sampling.
   - Systematic sampling.
   - Stratified sampling.
   - Cluster sampling.
2. **Non-Probability Sampling**:
   - Area sampling.
   - Multistage sampling.
   - Sequential sampling.
   - Convenience sampling.
   - Judgmental sampling.
   - Snowball sampling.
   - Accidental sampling.
   - Quota sampling.
   - Panel sampling.

### **Methods of Data Collection**

**Types of Data**:
- **Primary Data**: Collected first-hand for the first time.
- **Secondary Data**: Already collected by someone else and used for analysis.

**Collection Methods for Primary Data**:
1. **Observation**:
   - Advantages: Generates large quantities of usable data, relatively inexpensive.
   - Disadvantages: Expensive, limited information, requires extensive training.
2. **Interview**:
   - Types: Personal and telephonic interviews.
   - Merits: In-depth information, flexibility, low non-response rate.
   - Demerits: Expensive, time-consuming, potential for biased information.
3. **Questionnaire**:
   - Sent to respondents to answer and return.
   - Questions are structured in a predefined order.
   - Merits: Cost-effective for large-scale surveys.
   - Demerits: Non-response and misinterpretation of questions.
4. **Schedules**:
   - Researcher fills out details based on respondent's answers.

### **Hypothesis and Hypothesis Testing**

**Definition**:
A hypothesis is a proposition or set of propositions proposed as an explanation for phenomena. It is predictive and testable.

**Characteristics of a Good Hypothesis**:
1. Clear and precise.
2. Testable through observation or experimentation.
3. States relationships between variables (if relational).
4. Limited in scope and specific.
5. Simple and understandable.
6. Consistent with known facts.
7. Amenable to testing within a reasonable timeframe.
8. Explains the facts that prompted its formulation.

**Types of Hypotheses**:
1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Assumes no effect or difference.
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ)**: Proposes an effect or difference exists.

**One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Tests**:
- **One-Tailed Test**: Tests for deviations in one direction.
- **Two-Tailed Test**: Tests for deviations in both directions.

**Procedure for Hypothesis Testing**:
1. **Formal Statement**:
   - Clearly state the null (H₀) and alternative hypotheses (Hₐ).
2. **Select Significance Level**:
   - Common levels: 5% or 1%.
   - Influenced by sample size, variability, and directionality.
3. **Choose Distribution**:
   - Select a suitable distribution for the test statistic.
4. **Random Sampling and Value Computation**:
   - Draw samples and compute relevant test statistics.
5. **Probability Calculation**:
   - Determine the likelihood of observing results under H₀.
6. **Compare Probability**:
   - Decide whether to reject or accept H₀ based on comparison with significance level.
