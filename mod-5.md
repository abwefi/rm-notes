## Research Methodology & Intellectual Property Rights (Module 5)

### 1. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)

#### Definition and Importance:
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are legally recognized rights that grant creators and inventors protection for their innovations and creations. The importance of IPRs lies in:
- **Encouraging Creativity**: Providing incentives for new inventions.
- **Recognition**: Offering due credit to creators.
- **Economic Growth**: Promoting innovation, industrial development, and healthy competition.
- **Consumer Benefits**: Ensuring quality and authenticity.
- **Poverty Alleviation**: Influencing trade and economic policies.

#### Rationale of IPRs:
- Rewards creativity and innovation through protection.
- Facilitates dissemination of knowledge and quality goods.
- Stimulates economic growth and cultural diversity.
- Protects developers' investments in R&D.
- Addresses piracy and counterfeiting, safeguarding societal interests.

### 2. Types of Intellectual Property Rights

#### 1. **Patents**:
- Protect inventions providing exclusive rights to the patent holder.
- Governed by national and international patent laws.

#### 2. **Copyrights**:
- Protect creators' rights over literary, artistic, and digital works.
- Examples: Books, films, computer programs.
- Governed by "The Copyright Act, 1957" in India.

#### 3. **Trademarks**:
- Distinguishing symbols, names, or marks of products and services.
- Governed by "The Trade Marks Act, 1999."

- Protect products originating from specific locations with unique characteristics.
- Example: Darjeeling Tea.
- Governed by "The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999."

#### 5. **Industrial Designs**:
- Protect the aesthetic aspects of products.

#### 6. **Integrated Circuits and Layout Designs**:
- Ensure protection for semiconductor configurations.

#### 7. **WIPOâ€™s Role in IPRs**:
